# CHELSA-CMIP6

This repository contains a jupyter notebook that should facilitate the access and use of the [CHELSA-CMIP6 package](https://doi.org/10.1111/ecog.06535). It allows to check the model combinations that can be used to create bioclimatic variables with the CHELSA-CMIP6 package, as many CMIP6 models do not provide input data for all SPP scenarios. Furthermore, this notebook allows users to run the package in their browser and to generate bioclimatic variables for their region of interest. It is part of the News and Views piece ["Improving access and use of climate projections for ecological research" in Ecography](https://doi.org/10.1111/ecog.07186).
